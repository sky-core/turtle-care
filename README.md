# Sea Turtle Hatchery Management System 🌊🐢

Welcome to the Sea Turtle Hatchery Management System! This project is dedicated to helping sea turtle conservation efforts by managing the conditions in hatcheries to influence the sex ratio of turtle hatchlings.

## 📜 Overview

Sea turtles are facing challenges due to climate change and other environmental factors. One crucial aspect of their survival is maintaining a balanced sex ratio. By carefully controlling the incubation temperature of the eggs in hatcheries, we can encourage the development of female turtles, which are vital for the continuation of the species.

## 🌡️ How It Works

The software allows hatchery managers to:
- **Monitor** the temperature of the hatchery in real-time.
- **Control** the temperature to ensure optimal conditions for producing more female turtles.
- **Track** incubation progress and adjust settings as needed.
- **Analyze** data to improve hatchery practices over time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Keep track of hatchery conditions at a glance.
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust settings to create the desired environment for egg incubation.
- **Alerts & Notifications**: Get alerts when conditions deviate from the optimal range.
- **Data Analysis**: Review incubation data to refine and improve strategies.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/sky-core/turtle-care.git

## 📈 Usage

- **Start the Application**: Once running, you can monitor the hatchery conditions via the dashboard.
- **Set Temperature**: Use the control panel to set the desired temperature range.
- **Track Progress**: Monitor the development of the eggs and make adjustments as needed.

## 🐢 Why This Matters

- Maintaining a balanced population of male and female turtles is crucial for the species' survival. By using this software, hatcheries can play a significant role in conservation efforts by ensuring more female turtles are born, helping to stabilize and grow the population.
